# Xirtam: ICCS 311: Functional and Parallel Programming term project by Nattamon Santrakul & Krittin Pornthippithak
## Overview
Implement variance functions to calculate mathematical problems (e.g. calculus and linear algebra) using parallel programming. Using the parallel technique, we aim to optimize time complexity compared to sequential programming.
## Functions that was implemented 
- `matrixMult`: Multiplication of matrix
- `dot`: Dot product of vector 
- `det`: Determinant of matrix
- `trace`: Trace of matrix
- `transpose`: Transpose of matrix
